**Recipe: Heart-Healthy Steamed Fish with Lemon-Garlic Spinach**

**Goal:** This recipe aims to provide a delicious, low-sodium, low-saturated-fat meal rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals, all of which support cardiovascular health.

**Yields:** 1 serving
**Prep time:** 10 minutes
**Cook time:** 15-20 minutes

**Ingredients:**

*   **Fish (4-6 oz):**
    *   1 fillet of white fish (cod, tilapia, haddock, or sole). These are lean and low in saturated fat.
*   **Spinach:**
    *   5 oz (about 5 cups) fresh spinach, washed thoroughly.
*   **Flavorings:**
    *   1 clove garlic, minced very finely.
    *   1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice.
    *   1 teaspoon olive oil (extra virgin).
    *   1/4 teaspoon dried dill.
    *   Pinch of black pepper (optional). Omit if salt is a major concern.
*   **Optional Garnish:**
    *   Lemon wedge.
    *   Fresh parsley, chopped (a sprinkle).

**Equipment:**

*   Steamer basket or bamboo steamer
*   Pot with lid to fit the steamer
*   Small skillet

**Instructions:**

1.  **Prepare the Spinach:**
    *   Heat the olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat.
    *   Add the minced garlic and cook for about 30 seconds, or until fragrant, being careful not to burn it.
    *   Add the spinach to the skillet.  It will seem like a lot, but it will wilt down quickly.
    *   Stir frequently until the spinach is wilted and tender (about 2-3 minutes).
    *   Stir in the lemon juice and black pepper (if using).  Remove from heat and set aside.

2.  **Prepare the Steamer:**
    *   Fill the pot with about an inch of water.  Make sure the water level is below the steamer basket.
    *   Bring the water to a gentle boil.

3.  **Steam the Fish:**
    *   Place the fish fillet in the steamer basket.
    *   Sprinkle the dried dill over the fish.
    *   Cover the pot tightly with the lid.
    *   Steam the fish for about 6-10 minutes, or until it is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork.  The cooking time will vary depending on the thickness of the fillet.  *Important:* Ensure the fish reaches an internal temperature of 145°F (63°C).

4.  **Assemble and Serve:**
    *   Carefully remove the fish from the steamer basket.
    *   Place the wilted spinach on a plate.
    *   Top the spinach with the steamed fish.
    *   Garnish with a lemon wedge and a sprinkle of fresh parsley (if desired).
    *   Serve immediately.

**Nutritional Benefits (per serving, approximate):**

*   **Omega-3 Fatty Acids:**  From the fish, these are vital for heart health, reducing triglycerides and blood pressure.
*   **Low Saturated Fat:** Using lean fish and minimal olive oil keeps saturated fat intake low, helping to manage cholesterol levels.
*   **Fiber:** Spinach provides dietary fiber, which aids in cholesterol reduction and promotes healthy digestion.
*   **Vitamins and Minerals:** Spinach is rich in vitamins A, C, K, and folate, as well as minerals like iron and magnesium, all beneficial for overall health. Fish also provides essential vitamins such as Vitamin D.
*   **Protein:** Lean fish is an excellent source of protein, important for maintaining muscle mass and satiety.
*   **Low Sodium:** This recipe intentionally avoids added salt, relying on herbs, garlic, and lemon for flavor.  This is crucial for managing blood pressure.
*   **Antioxidants:** Spinach is high in antioxidants.

**Important Considerations for Heart Disease:**

*   **Sodium Control:** This recipe is designed to be low in sodium. Avoid adding any salt.  Check labels of any pre-packaged ingredients.
*   **Fat Control:** This recipe uses a small amount of olive oil, which is a healthy monounsaturated fat. Avoid saturated and trans fats.
*   **Fish Choices:**  Choose white fish like cod, tilapia, or haddock, which are low in fat. Salmon, while higher in fat, is a great source of omega-3 fatty acids and can be included in the diet a couple of times a week if portioned appropriately.
*   **Preparation Methods:** Steaming is an ideal cooking method because it doesn't require adding extra fats.  Avoid frying or sautéing in unhealthy fats.
*   **Portion Control:** Be mindful of portion sizes, especially for fish. A 4-6 ounce serving is generally recommended.
*   **Individual Needs:**  This recipe is a suggestion.  Always consult with a doctor or registered dietitian for personalized dietary advice, especially if you have specific medical conditions or are taking medications. They can tailor recommendations to your individual needs and help you manage your heart disease effectively.
*   **Fresh Ingredients:** Use fresh, high-quality ingredients whenever possible for the best flavor and nutritional value.
*   **Read all labels:** Always read the labels before buying anything, and avoid anything with too much salt.
Enjoy this heart-healthy meal!
